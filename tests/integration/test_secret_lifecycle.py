"""Boot-time secret lifecycle for routstr-core #553 (config ownership).

Whole-system proof of the secret behaviours that only show up across a real
container *boot* — the things the standing single-boot stack (and the in-repo
unit/integration suite) structurally cannot exercise:

  * a node carrying a Nostr identity refuses to start without
    ``ROUTSTR_SECRET_KEY`` and prints the key-generation command (issue step 2);
  * a fresh node with no admin password GENERATES one, hashes it into the Secret
    store, and logs it once with the admin URL — and that logged password logs in
    (issue step 4 / bootstrap branch 3);
  * changing ``ROUTSTR_SECRET_KEY`` under an already-encrypted nsec BRICKS the
    node (fail fast) rather than silently losing the identity — #553 has no key
    rotation, only detection;
  * an nsec encrypted into the Secret store SURVIVES a later boot once ``NSEC``
    has left the env (the #553 upgrade path), instead of being clobbered back to
    empty (bootstrap branch 1 + the strip-on-write regression guard).

These each boot throwaway nodes with tailored env via ``node_boot`` (the standing
node-a can't be reconfigured per-test). Marked ``destructive`` so they auto-skip
under TARGET_PROFILE=remote — they need local docker, not a deployed node.

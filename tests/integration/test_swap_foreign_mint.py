"""Foreign-mint swap on wallet topup (routstr-core swap_to_primary_mint).

When a node receives a Cashu token issued by a mint it does NOT trust
(`token.mint not in CASHU_MINTS`), it swaps the value to its primary mint:
mint-quote on primary -> melt the foreign proofs to pay that invoice ->
mint fresh proofs on primary. This exercises the real swap path end to end
through `POST /v1/wallet/topup`, with two local nutshell FakeWallet mints
(`primary-mint` trusted, `foreign-mint` untrusted) so it runs with real Cashu
crypto and zero real sats.

Run config (set by the swap_foreign_mint scenario): the node must trust ONLY
the primary mint, i.e. `CASHU_MINTS=http://primary-mint:3338`, so a
`foreign-mint` token triggers the swap instead of a plain same-mint redeem.

Marked `destructive` (creates a key + credits balance) so it auto-skips under
TARGET_PROFILE=remote.
